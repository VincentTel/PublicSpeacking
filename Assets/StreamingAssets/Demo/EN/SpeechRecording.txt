7.983|so good day everyone I'm here to introduce our system
14.635|so the main goal for work is to improve the presentation skills of the user
17.868|is also to improve the conference in
26.485|so for this except especially helpful for people like me who have difficulties in expressing their thoughts
33.063|so what is that vantage for system compared to actual dream
35.664|in doing some presentations
44.005|the first problem is that we need to find an audience to listen to our presentation and give it back
48.759|so our system can provide this audiences by
50.616|a virtual avatar
54.875|so we can simulate people listening to our percentage
62.215|another disadvantage is to try and get close to the final environment as possible
77.323|so that mean advantage of the system is that it's really easy to create with virtual environment that are as close to the real presentation stage as much as
82.252|the last is advantage is that
102.228|all the feedback depends on the audience so the feedback that you receive is limited to the experience and knowledge of the listening users listening audience so the main advantage of her system is that it will give accurate feedback because this is based from sensors and from
103.602|feedback from the
108.123|so for a user experience
114.139|the user can do as many self presentations as he was possible
119.056|end his able to receive real time feedback and accurate feedback
124.548|empty can also see after each and every presentacion self
129.162|representation of himself through avatar which action
133.527|with this he can see his improvements overtime
141.269|so to summarize everything the main features of our system is that it provides real time feedback
144.202|it can record presentation
147.845|and were able to review representations
149.643|and analyze our feedback
